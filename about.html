            <p class="about__me--text">I have been dancing since I was two years old. Following a short experience with a very structured toddler group, my parents decided I might be better placed in Ballet, as during the group all I wanted to do
              was get up and perform in front of all of the other children and parents… (much to the organisers frustration, as this meant the other children followed my lead oops!) </p>
            <p class="about__me--text">The class was great but did not allow room for my free spirited nature, when I heard music all I wanted was to dance and so my journey began…</p>
            <p class="about__me--text">After proudly collecting my I.S.T.D (Imperial Society Teachers of Dance) graded and vocational examination certificates (Primary- Advanced 1), I was lucky enough to be accepted into vocational training at
              Northern Ballet School (Manchester, UK). During this time I studied Ballet, Tap, Modern, Jazz, Street Dance, Musical Theatre and Contemporary dance. I am now almost complete in my I.S.T.D DDE (Diploma in Dance Education), to further my
              teaching expertise and enable me to enter my students for examination, just as I undertook all those years ago.</p>
            <p class="about__me--text">I am also mum to my wonderful daughter, who is quickly following in my footsteps at only two years old!</p>
